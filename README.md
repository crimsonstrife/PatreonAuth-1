## 1. Idea and Use Case

This plugin is a remake of the [TwitchAuth](https://github.com/mrbandler/TwitchAuth) to be used with the Patreon API.

----

## 2. Installation

To install the plugin simply download it over the [Unreal Engine Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace). Click [here](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/patreon-auth) to download.

**The alternative:**

Download the plugin via the releases tab, unzip the archive and drop the unzipped folder into either a local plugins folder on your project. If your project is a blueprint only project simply add a dummy C++ class to you project to create the plugins folder.

Or install it engine wide in the ``<folder_to_your_ue4_installation/UE_4.19/Engine/Plugins``. If you didn't change the installation directory of your UE4 installation the folder should be under ``C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_4.19\Engine\Plugins``.

> **NOTE:** A detailed guide for both manual installation types can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/mrbandler/TwitchAuth/wiki).
